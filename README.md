# LaTeXNet

An implementation of 18-layer RezNet to convert handwritten symbols to LaTeX notation.

Digitizing handwritten mathematical notes through LaTeX can be time-consuming. Via deep learning, this model identifies and classifies handwritten mathematical expressions in LaTeX. 

The data used for this project come from the [HASYv2 dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/guru001/hasyv2)
